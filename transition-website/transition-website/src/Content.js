I am a former Active Duty Staff Sergeant who served 8 years in the Army. During my service, I was a "hard charger", "high speed", "highly motivated" NCO and I gave everything I had to making my Soldiers lives better. When I started the transition process, I was not expecting it to be so confusing, frustrating, and complicated. I made this guide to help you get out of the Military with less stress and more success.' }

    // <p className='card-text'>If you are feeling a little uncertain about getting out, here's my advice: <br></br>DO IT!!<br></br>There is a reason why you considered getting out and most of us get caught in the trap of staying in the Military because it seems easier to deal with the problems we know instead of dealing with new problems.</p>
    // <h2>YOU ARE GOING TO BE OK!</h2>

    // 'AvoidPage' : `<h2> Stop asking your buddies if you should get out</h2>
    //  <p> Instead, ask someone who found success outside of the Military about their experience. 9 times out of 10, they're going to tell you they're happy they got out.</p> <h2>Stop waiting to start SFL TAP</h2><p>You need to start SFL TAP now!  By law, you are authorized to start SFL TAP 18 months before your the end of your contract. By starting now, you will get introduced to so many resources and people who will help you.</p><h2>Stop trying to tough it out</h2>
    //  <p>I had a lot of medical issues that I refused to get help with because I thought I was being tough. That was STUPID. You probably have some aches, pains, problems sleeping, anger, anxiety, knee problems, feet problems, back problems etc.. Go to the freaking medic today and get seen. You earned this healthcare and you will need the evidence for your VA claim.</p><h2>Stop saying "I'll figure it out when I get out"<h2><p>Figuring out what to do when I was leaving the Army was one of the hardest decisions to make. A counselor asked me if I had 6 months to plan a mission, range, training, or deployment, would I be stressed about it? No.  That's plenty of time.  So start planning your next move now so that you will have time to pick a career that makes you happy when you get out.</p>`
