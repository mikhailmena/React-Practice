          My name is Marc and I want to help you transition out of the Military without feeling overwhelmed and frustrated. I am a former Active Duty Staff Sergeant who served 8 years in the Army. During my service, I was a "hard charger", "high speed", "highly motivated" NCO and I gave everything I had to making my Soldiers' lives better. When I started the transition process, I was not expecting it to be so confusing, frustrating, and complicated. I made this guide to help you get out of the Military with less stress and more success.
