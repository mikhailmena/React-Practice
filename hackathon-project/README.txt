I am going to turn this TO pdf into a fillable form
when you go to the website, you enter all of the fields 
once you click "submit" it creates a file that you can download
Copy the formatting from the pdf
use the Parsley js library

I used the parsley js library
I am able to use the submit button to validate the form
The next feature is to make a second div that sends the field information to that div witha completed form
next feature is to be able to download that div as a pdf
